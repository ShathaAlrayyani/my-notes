I learned from this website that you need to test your code When you have a bug, You should see it with your own eyes before applying the fix.</br> Also you should do some Documentation and Commenting so you remember what you did and why.</br>
the most important thing is when you need help you should ask for it, don't be embarrassed that it isnâ€™t already working , and sometime you just need to stop working and take a break .
